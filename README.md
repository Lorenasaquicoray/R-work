# R-work
📊 Mini Data Analysis & Visualization Projects
A collection of small, hands‑on projects created to practice data exploration, cleaning, and visualization. Each project uses real datasets and applies tools from both **R and Python** to build clear, insightful graphics and strengthen **analytical thinking**.

🎯 **Purpose**
These mini projects document my learning process as I develop skills in:

- Understanding and **exploring datasets**

- Cleaning and preparing data for analysis

- **Creating visualizations** that communicate patterns clearly

- Comparing visualization approaches across languages and libraries

🛠️ **Tools & Libraries**
- R: tidyverse, ggplot2

- Python: pandas, matplotlib

- Other: basic statistics, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA)

📁 What You’ll Find in This Repository
- R Markdown / Quarto files with full analysis

- Python scripts for **visualization and data manipulation**

- Plots generated during the projects

- Datasets used for practice (or links to them)

- Short explanations of insights and decisions made during the analysis

📚 What These Projects Demonstrate
Ability to work with structured datasets

- Understanding of visualization principles

- Skill in building plots such as histograms, scatterplots, bar charts, and multi‑panel figures

- Clear, organized code with comments and explanations

- Growth in both R and Python data workflows

🚀 Goal
**To build a strong, transparent portfolio that shows my progress in data analytics and visualization, while practicing real‑world skills used in data science roles.**
